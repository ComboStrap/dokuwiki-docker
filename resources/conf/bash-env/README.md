# Bash files

## About
These are just bash function libraries that
are called by the [entrypoint script](../../dokuwiki-docker/bin/dokuwiki-docker-entrypoint)
via the [profile](profile)


To get them via the command line at exec, you need to start a login shell. ie: 
```bash
docker exec -ti dokwuiki-docker bash -l
```
